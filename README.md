# Hello

My name is Jesser and I'm studying software engineering. I'm migrating to GitLab so this account eventually will be a 100% mirror of every project that I will do on GitLab!
In that sense, this will be more like my secondary or backup account which doesn't mean that I will stop using it anytime soon.

If you want you can go to my [GitLab account][1]!
